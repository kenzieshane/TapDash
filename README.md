This is a project that is made by SteveIndoPlayScratch and me using Turbowarp and then compiled into a HTML Project.
I know this is probably not a webgame, but I've spent so much time developing it that i hope it qualifies as it. Game originally made by SteveIndoPLayScratch and now fully developed alone by Kenzie Shane S. (His cousin XD)

Welcome to our cool game website! You could make your player (The cube) move by arrow keys. This game have full mobile and touchscreen support. The cube will keep dashing until it touches a block. You must open switch by pressing e, so the blocker will open. You will die if you touches spike or edge, you could teleport with teleporter and it had 3 seconds cooldown. Full guide is on the game so what are you waiting for? It's FREE! (as in freedom to remix, adapt code and price-wise) You could customize your character, game themes, and you must finish all level by touching the finish flag. This version of the game is discontinued.
