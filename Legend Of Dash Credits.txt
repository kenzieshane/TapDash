Thank you Turbowarp and Scratch developer team for making this possible.
Turbowarp EXtensions also saved me a TON of times developing this.
Visit https://github.com/kenzieshane/Legendofdashwebsit for more info.
No AI were used in the development of this software. All of the game's assets
are also licensed on the same way the whole project is licensed. 
 
TL;DR Give Credits. It's just a Scratch/Turbowarp Project afterall...I'm Sorry.
